As we learned in class, this project is divided into 3 parts:

* [udacity-c2-frontend](https://github.com/ricardiles/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-frontend)
* [udacity-c2-restapi](https://github.com/ricardiles/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-restapi)
* [image-filter-starter-code](https://github.com/ricardiles/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code)

The principal task is create a new endpoint for The Image Filter Starter Code and use everything learned in the module. 

In the readme of the [image-filter-starter-code](https://github.com/ricardiles/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code) you can find more information about what has been done and evidence of the deployment in addition to the tests carried out.
